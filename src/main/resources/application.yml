# Unlike yaml file helps us to group properties of similar types are single place.
# Since this file is at root of classpath and there is application.properties file in config package, spring will give precedence
# to config.application.properties and will ignore this file.
# NOTE: Spring do not completely ignore file, rahter if same property exists in config.application.properties and this file, spring boot will give precedence to file in config package.
# IF there is no propery in config.application.properties, then property defiened here will add up or contribue to application properties.
